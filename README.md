## Team-A-assignment-1
This is the first assignment given to our team in the internship. This is a single-page website developed using Next.js and TailwindCSS

## Getting Started

To run the project in your local environment use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KILLERTIAN/team-a-assignment-1.git
# then
npm install
```

To start a local server use

npm run dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
